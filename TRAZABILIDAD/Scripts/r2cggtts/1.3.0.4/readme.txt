Dear colleagues.

I am afraid the setup program is in French but it is a standard Windows one.
Necessary setup file is: "r2cggttsv1304sources.zip".

Please install the program in: "c:\program files\r2cggtts\"

Otherwize it will not work since some specific files are expected to be there.


If you already have installed any version of the program,
Please just uncompress the latest UPDATE version: "r2cggttsv1304update.zip"
in "c:\program files\r2cggtts\"

The source code program is in file : "r2cggttsv1304code.zip"


Windows Regional Settings of your system must be:
"." decimal symbol,
"jj/mm/aaaa" for date.

Some troubles are known with Windows XP operating system.

Please feel free to ask in case of troubles.

Best regards,
