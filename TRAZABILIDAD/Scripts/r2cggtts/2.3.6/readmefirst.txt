A new FTP server is available for uploading your data to the BIPM Time Section.
It replaces our old FTP server (IP adress: 62.161.69.22 which is still available).

A specific directory for data of each laboratory was created.
You can put your data in the remote directory "/data/XXXX/" where "XXXX" is the BIPM acronym of your laboratory.
You can create sub-directory in this folder, for example :
use sub-directory "clocks" for clock data files and sub-directory "links" for GPS data files
(you can create sub-directory in "links" if you have several types of receiver).

Please feel free to ask in case of troubles.
